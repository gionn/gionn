### Hi there 👋

My name is **Giovanni Toraldo** and I was born in [Lucca][lucca] (Italy). 🇮🇹

I am an [Open Source enthusiast 🐧][1] with [SuperCow Powers 🐮][2], a
Java/Ruby/whatever developer 🧑🏻‍💻, writer of the [OpenNebula 3 Cloud Computing][3]
[book ☁️][4].

I currently work as Solution Developer at [Engineering D.HUB][5],
developing the [ClouDesire][6] platform I co-founded in 2016.

During the weekends I shoot with a [medieval crossbow 🎯][7] for a reenactment association.

My resume (CV) is [here](https://gionn.net/files/giovanni-toraldo-cv.pdf).
